    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p class="intro-text">Hello! My name is Claire Stewart and I am a currently a senior at Northeastern University. I study Computer Science and Communications but am mainly focused on
         Computer Science. I am originally
        from outside of Philadelphia, but now live in Boston. My website will introduce one of my hobbies - which is dance! (Specifically Take it To the Floor)
    Take it to the Floor is a greek life dance competition that takes place every semester. Take it to the Floor in the fall and Greek Sing and in the spring. 
Each semester a sorority and fraternity are paired up to practice and perform a 6 minute long dance + skit. This year's theme is Disney Channel Original Movies and 
my theme is Jump In. This is my third year participating in TITTF and I am so excited to perform again this year, it is my favorite part of being in a sorority! The competition raises money for the 
Mission Hill Neighborhood Housing Service to give back to the local community where most students live. This is a great cause and I am proud to be a part of it! Donate to 
Chi Omega and Delta Tau Delta's page if you would like to support us!
